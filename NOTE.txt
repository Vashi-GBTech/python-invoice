"""The modification .+?(?=\s|$) in the pattern means:
.+? will match any character (except for a newline), one or more times, but as few times as possible (non-greedy).
(?=\s|$) is a positive lookahead assertion that checks for either a whitespace character \
 s or the end of the line $ without including it in the match.
